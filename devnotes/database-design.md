# Backend design
## Tasks
### Specify the database requirements. Justify your choice.
I will design the database to the BASE model (basically available, soft state, and eventually consistent), rather than the ACID model, since
* Availability is a higher priority than consistency.
* The same data will not be accessed by several clients at once in any foreseeable future of this application.
* Development velocity is a higher priority than data stability.


### Choose a technology. Justify your choice.
I will use MongoDB for the database. It uses a simple, flexible NoSQL data model. I chose MongoDB because
* It's simple.
* It's easily extendable, should I choose to expand my site's functionality.
* It's widely used in industry.
* Community support and integration documentation is strong. MongoDB is commonly used in concert with the other elements of my stack.


### Design a NoSQL database structure for the site's services.
Projects                collection

Project
|- objectID             str
|- title                str
|- dateFrom             int
|- dateTo               int
|- summary              str
|- skills               str
|- body                 str

Blogs                   collection

Blog                    dict
|- objectID             str
|- title                str
|- datePublished        int
|- body                 str

Subscribers             collection

Subscriber              dict
|- objectID             str
|- name                 str
|- emailAddress         str
|- dateTimeSubscribed   int
|- subscriptions        [str ObjectID]

BugReports
|- objectID             str
|- emailAddress         str
|- dateTime             int
|- route                str
|- report               str


### Design a second NoSQL database structure for logging.
Common Log Format compliant (host ident authsubscriber date request status bytes).

AdminLogs               collection

AdminLog                dict
|- host                 str
|- ident                str
|- authuser             str
|- date                 str
|- request              str
|- status               str
|- bytes                int
|- userAgent            str
|- referrer             str
|- ip                   str
|- responseTime         int

SubscriberLogs          collection

SubscriberLog           dict
As for AdminLog.

ErrorLogs               collection

ErrorLog                dict
As for AdminLog, and
|- message
|- stackTrace


## Enhancing the backend
Future options include
1. Caching.
2. Indexing with MongoDB.
3. Compression.
4. Lazy loading / file splitting.
5. Optimising assets.
