Note: Some extension of this experiment could be used as
- Carousel display
- Curved wall, itself an extension of the carousel display
Adaptive styling in the carousel/wall will be very challenging
to write in hcj. Would probably be a lot easier in a purpose-built
3D library. However, much less performant.

Should start with a simpler version as a stopgap and come back to this
later. 
- Landing menu: Full-page card grid with some white squares to display 
    all the collections together.
- 2nd level: Click-through carousel for individual collections.
  - Layout: collection title and notes across top of page. Images
            clickable for full-screen focus. Left/right buttons at 
            screen bottom edges transition between photos.
- Should photos be fetched from a server to avoid sending too much data
  to the client?
